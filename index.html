    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p>The images above show some olympians in their stride, making their  way down the "olympic".</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Course</h3>
     <p><strong>The Olympic</strong> is a pool of water that rushes down a course clreating swirls and rapids of water
     for the olympians to fly down.</p>
     <hr>
     <h3>Objective</h3>
     <p><strong>The objective</strong> of this sport is to get to the bottom of the course while going through gates without hitting
     them before going through the finish line.</p>
     <hr>
     <h3>Obstacles</h3>
     <p><strong>Gates</strong> are two wooden rods that hang down from lines going over the course. Each gate has a number and
     a colour. The number reffers to the order that you go through and the colour is to do with 
     direction you go through the gate. Green being down through the gate and red being going up through the gate.
     Up is up against the flow of the water, down being down with the flow of the water.</p>

        <p>The some of the images that have been shown are the people at the peak of this sport going down fast moving water, this isnt neccersary. Most of our members go to a slow moving river and take their kid down for a paddle.
            Getting started in coneing has a very low learning curve as you don't need to know much to get the boat moving and to have fun.
